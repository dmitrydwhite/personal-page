      <h3>Set Up:</h3>
      <p>The Floor is Lava.</p>
      <p>There is a Trail of Chairs as well as a Castle Table where you store the Beer (or the Pawns of the Secret Order), the King of the Castle (or the unopened bottle of Jack Daniels whiskey), and the Cards.  There should be 13 or more Chairs (or Spots), and there should be an odd number of them.  You can set them up in a loopy pattern or just a circle.  There must be at least one Spot adjacent to the Castle Table.</p>
      <p>There is a Sword Table where you store all the Swords.  Or Boxing Gloves.  Or Nerf Guns.  Or a combination of all of these.</p>
      <p>There is a Canada Table where you store the rest of the Hard Alcohol or Mickey’s (other than the King of the Castle).</p>
      <p>Designate a Junkyard Zone in an out-of-the-way area.  Place an appropriate container for empty beverage containers, which is called the Hot Box, in the midst of the Junkyard.</p>

      <h3>Game Play:</h3>
      <section>
        <h4>Phase 1:</h4>
        <p>Once the Trail of Chairs is set up, all Players should grab 2 beers.  Someone calls out, “1, 2, 3, GO!”  Everyone puts up a number of Fingers to their forehead.  Add your number to the number the person to your left is showing, and that’s the Chair you start on (counting the first Chair after the Castle Table as 1).  Someone then shouts out, “1, 2, 3, 4, JFK!”  Everyone else responds, “FDR!” and everyone goes to their spot.  The same person then shouts, “ABE LINCOLN, GEORGE WASHINGTON!”  Everyone else responds, “CHERRY TREE!”  Then everyone chugs their first beer.  (“Shotgunning” is explicitly permitted at this time.)  Whoever finishes first starts out as the first True American.</p>
        <p>If someone is next to the Castle Table, then they Draw and take one of the Pawns of the Secret Order.  (If there is more than one person next to the Castle Table, then the person who is furthest ahead Draws a Card.)  Then, if you have a free hand, you must take another Beer.  Announce the number on your Card, then start Chugging while all the other Players count down from the number on your Card.  For numbers 5 and above, you must shout “AMERICA!” after completing your Chug, and everyone else must take a Drink.  If you complete your Chug, you move forward the same number of chairs as the Card you drew.  Everyone else moves forward half that number.  If you fail your Chug (known as a Sputter), then you move back 2 chairs, and the current True American moves forward the same number of chairs shown on your card.  If you Draw a 2 or a 3, then when you finish your Chug you throw the card in the Junkyard.  If your Card lands in the Hot Box, then everyone else takes a Drink and the True American declares “HOT BOX!”.  If you draw a Queen, she counts as a 5 for Chugging and moving purposes.  A Draw of a King or a Jack makes you the First Undisputed True American, and ends Phase 1.</p>
        <p>If no one is by the Castle Table, then the True American shouts, “AMERICANS! LET’S DO THE COUNT!”  Everyone then counts together, “1, 2, 3!”  They then hold up a number of fingers to their heads.  If someone matches the True American’s number, that player moves forward the total number of theirs and the True American’s fingers.  (For example, if the True American holds up one finger and Russell holds up one finger, then Russell moves forward 2 chairs.  If the True American holds up one finger and both Russell and Winston hold up one finger, then Russell and Winston both move forward 2 chairs.)  If no one’s finger number matches the True American’s, then the True American moves forward the number of fingers he held up.  Whoever didn’t move has to drink.  When Doing The Count, if someone reaches the Castle Table, they stop, even if they have more moves left, and then it’s their turn to Draw.</p>
        <p>Phase 1 ends when either a) All the Players have successfully completed a Chug after drawing a 5 or higher, or b) Someone Draws either a King or Jack and becomes the first Undisputed True American.</p>

        <h4>Phase 2:</h4>
        <p>A Hat or Helmet must be Worn at ALL TIMES after Phase 1, unless you are Wearing a Mask.</p>

        <section>
          <h5>Card and Moving Rules:</h5>
          <p>Other than an A, 2, or 3, the general rule for cards is on an even number, the Drawing Player moves the full number, and everyone else moves half that.  For an odd number, if the player completes the Skill Task, then they move the full number, if they fail they move 1 Spot.  Everyone else moves 1 Spot regardless on an odd-numbered draw. If you are at the Canada Table, you can only move on an odd-numbered draw.  If no one is by the Castle Table, then the True American must Do The Count.</p>
          <h6>Ace - Declare a Zone</h6>
          <p>Your Zone must include adjacent Spots, and can be no more than ¼ of the total number of Spots.  If you Draw the Ace of Spades, you can declare a Crazy Zone, which means the Spots in your Zone don’t have to be adjacent.  You can make up any Rules for the Zone that you want, for Example a Backwards Zone where everyone has to move from Spot to Spot backwards, a Sipping Zone where everyone has to take a sip every time they move from Spot to Spot, a Singing Zone where everyone in the Zone has to sing instead of talk, a Shirtless Zone where everyone has to take off their shirt while they are in the Zone, etc.  You are in charge of Enforcing the Rules in the Zone that You declared.  Everyone moves forward 1 Spot.</p>
          <h6>2 - Do a Chair Dance</h6>
          <p>Everyone else Drinks.  The True American decides if your Chair Dance is acceptable.  If your Dance is acceptable, you move forward 2 Spots, everyone else moves 1.  If it is not, you move back 4 spots, and everyone except the True American moves forward 2.</p>
          <h6>3 - Sing a Patriotic Song</h6>
          <p>Everyone else Drinks.  The True American decides if your Patriotic Song is acceptable.  (The True American may also decree that you have to sing another commonly known song, like a school fight song or alma mater, unit or service song, etc.)  You can order one other person (other than the True American) to sing along with you.  They don’t have to drink as long as they sing.  If your song is acceptable, everyone moves forward 3.  If not, you go to the Canada Table.</p>
          <h6>4 - World War II</h6>
          <p>Declare this by shouting, “THE ONLY THING WE HAVE TO FEAR!”  Everyone responds by shouting, “IS FEAR ITSELF!”  Pick half of the Players to Drink.</p>
          <h6>5 - Toss your Weapon back to the Sword Table</h6>
          <p>Declare this by shouting “I NEVER ADVOCATE WAR!”  Everyone else responds “EXCEPT AS A MEANS OF PEACE!”  Spill Rules apply.  If anyone Intercepts the Weapon, it’s theirs.  If the weapon lands in the Lava, you have failed your Skill Task.</p>
          <h6>6 - Lava Immunity.  Keep this card</h6>
          <p>You can use it for Lava Immunity (Accidental or Intentional) one time.  If you end up away from the Castle Table when you are done using it, you have to throw the Card in the Junkyard.  If you make it in the Hot Box, the True American declares “HOT BOX!” and awards you One Million Points.  Everyone else has to take a drink.</p>
          <h6>7 - Whackbat</h6>
          <p>Declare another player with a Weapon to be at the Whackbat.  Finish your beer and toss the empty container to the Player at Whackbat.  If he misses it,  you have failed your Skill Task, and you have to drink.  If he hits it, everyone else drinks.  If he hits it into the Hot Box, then the True American declares “HOT BOX!” and everyone else has to finish one beer.  You get 500,000 Points and the Player at Whackbat gets One Million Points.</p>
          <h6>8 - Reverse the Direction</h6>
          <p>Declare this by shouting “BACK TO THE FUTURE!”  Everyone Else responds “THINK, MCFLY! THINK!” Keep this Card if it is a Red 8.</p>
          <h6>9 - Wild Card</h6>
          <h6>10 - Civil Rights</h6>
          <p>Declare this by shouting “BACK OF THE BUS!”  Everyone else responds, “I HAVE A DREAM!” and drinks.  If someone has a Red 8, then they must swordfight the True American, and whoever wins is the New True American.  Hold on to this card, you can Declare Civil Rights again at any time.  Additional rule: If you Declare Civil Rights while you are not at the Castle Table, you have to throw the Card in the Junkyard.  If you make it in the Hot Box, the new True American declares “HOT BOX!” and awards you One Million Points.  Everyone else has to take a drink.</p>
          <h6>J - You are the new Undisputed True American</h6>
          <p>Declare this by shouting, “JFK!”  Everyone else shouts, “FDR!” and Drinks.</p>
          <h6>Q - Woman President</h6>
          <p>Declare this by shouting, “IT TAKES A VILLAGE!”  Everyone responds, “TO RAISE A CHILD!”  You Pose a Question to the rest of the Players requiring them to choose between two distinct options.  (Examples are, “Death by shark or by drowning?” “Boxers or Briefs?”  etc.)  The other Players vote with raised hands.  You decide which option is the winner (regardless of the amount of votes it gets), and whoever voted against it has to drink.  Then everyone moves 5 Spots.</p>
          <h6>K - You must dispute for True American</h6>
          <p>Declare this by shouting, “ABE LINCOLN!”  The current True American has to shout, “GEORGE WASHINGTON!”  Then everyone else shouts, “CHERRY TREE!” and Drinks.  If the current True American shouts “GEORGE WASHINGTON!”, then the two of you must Sword Fight to see who is the real True American.  If they don’t shout, then you are the new Undisputed True American, but you have to Drink.</p>
        </section>

        <p>Phase 2 ends when there are no more Pawns of the Secret Order on the Castle Table.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h4>Phase 3:</h4>
        <p>???</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h4>Lava Rules:</h4>
        <p>If you step in the Lava you are Dead.  You may reincarnate as a Canadian by taking a shot from one of the bottles at the Canada Table.  (To reincarnate as a Canadian is known colloquially as “to Mickeys back in”.)  Once reincarnated, you may return to whichever spot you choose, so long as the current True American approves of your reincarnation shot from the bottle.</p>
        <p>(This is known colloquially as "Mickey’s-ing Back In")</p>

        <h4>Swordfight Rules:</h4>
        <p>Any Blow from a Weapon or Shot from a Nerf Gun to the Face, Head, or Groin is a Killing Strike.</p>
        <p>If you touch the Lava during a Swordfight, then you lose the Swordfight but do not die.</p>

        <h4>General Rules Applicable at All Times:</h4>
        <p>If you are On or By the Canada Table when the Rules call for you to Drink, then you must drink from a Canada Table bottle unless you are Two-Fisting.</p>
        <p>If you are out of Beer when you pass the Canada Table, you have to take a Long Pull (even if you don’t land on a Spot by the Canada Table).  If you are holding an Empty when you reach any of the tables, you must throw it in the Junkyard and shout “ALL TRASH BELONGS...”  Everyone else responds, “IN THE JUNKYARD!” and Drinks.</p>
        <p>More than one player can be on a spot.  If there is more than one person on a Spot and any one of them falls into the Lava, then everyone on that Spot has to go in the Lava, take a Long Pull, and find a new Spot.</p>
        <p>Any time you pass the Sword Table you can pick up a Sword (Weapon), unless you already have one.</p>
        <p>You can Three-Fist if you want, but Four-Fisting is just plain Crazy.</p>

        <h4>Fall and Injury Rule:</h4>
        <p>General consensus should be reached for ending the game when it seems that the lives and limbs of players are exposed to undue risk from falls or injuries.</p>

        <h4>Violations of Rule Adjudicated by the True American:</h4>
        <p><em>Lack of Enthusiasm:</em> Any player who displays a marked and dismaying lack of enthusiasm for any aspect of the game can be docked Points or ordered to Drink.</p>

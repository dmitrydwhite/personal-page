    <h1>Opinions about Silverton's proposed Ordinance 24-15</h1>

    <p>Here is some information and opinions about the City of Silverton, Oregon's proposed update to its Camping Ordinance</p>

    <h3>Factual Background of the Issue:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Silverton's current camping ordinance is out-of-date, and elements of it would not be found Constitutional if it were challenged in court.</li>
        <li>Silverton City Council has been drafting an update to the camping ordinance.</li>
        <li>To limit the City's legal liability, one element of this proposed ordinance establishes a sanctioned campsite on publicly owned property.</li>
        <li>The ordinance can regulate when and how people stay at the sanctioned campsite, but it cannot limit who can stay there. For example, it can stipulate that all camping gear must be removed by a certain time, but it cannot stipulate that no one originally from Portland can stay the night there.</li>
        <li>The current proposed location for the sanctioned campsite is on the City-owned property on Westfield Street that also contains the Skate Park. This property is immediately adjacent to the Silverton Senior Center and Robert Frost Elementary School. Other locations considered were between First and Water Streets near the new City Hall building, and on the property that serves as the access easement from McClaine Street to the City Shops and Sheltering Silverton location.</li>
        <li>Sheltering Silverton has been providing shelter and homelessness services in Silverton in some form since the winter of 2016-17, and currently helps on the order of 100 individuals per year move off the street and reconnect to positive housing destinations.</li>
        <li>Sheltering Silverton currently provides comprehensive homelessness services in and around the City of Silverton. As a private 501c3 non-profit, they have established a service area and eligibility standards for a connection to that service area. When they encounter individuals who do not meet those eligibility standards, they have an established policy and procedure for connecting such individuals to organizations and communities where the individual is more likely to be able to successfully access resources.</li>
        <li>The official position of Sheltering Silverton, as presented to the City Council during public testimony during the last meeting, is “We oppose the criminalization of homelessness in the form of banning overnight camping, and we also oppose the corollary legal requirement to establish a sanctioned campsite that such a ban would require.”</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>My Personal Opinions about the Issue:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Sheltering Silverton has set the Gold Standard for addressing rural homelessness in the Willamette Valley, if not the entire State of Oregon. They are among the quickest and most effective organizations that have received state emergency funds to address homelessness. Their leadership has been asked to advise on issues of homelessness services at regional levels.</li>
        <li>Silverton and the surrounding area does not host any visible persistent homeless encampments. When camps are established or discovered, Sheltering Silverton works with landowners and police to redirect the individuals in the camp to the shelter facility or to positive destinations and helpful connections to services.</li>
        <li>By enacting a camping ban, the City Council would be ignoring the advice of the local experts and professionals, who also happen to be regional experts with a proven track record.</li>
        <li>By enacting a camping ban, the City Council would also undermine the work that Sheltering Silverton has done locally in at least two ways:</li>
        <ol>
            <li>It would create a legal and sanctioned persistent homeless encampment. While it would be technically regulated by city ordinance, actual on-the-ground enforcement (such as the removal of camping gear, waste, sharps, and trash etc.) would be the responsibility of the City Police and Public Works Departments, both of which have other priorities.</li>
            <li>It would undermine Sheltering Silverton's attitude of this community shouldering the responsibility for its own homeless and housing-insecure citizens, while also encouraging other communities to do the same. The City Council's proposed solution would allow people with no connection to or history in the local area to camp at the sanctioned campsite indefinitely.</li>
        </ol>
    </ul>

    <h3>How You Can Become Involved</h3>

    <p>The City Council will likely be discussing this issue at its next regular meeting on the first Monday of the month: <b>January 6th, 2025 at 6:30p.m.</b></p>
    <p>The most effective way for you to have your voice heard is to show up to the Council meeting in person and provide public testimony on this issue. When you testify, you will be asked to state your city of residence. If you don't live in Silverton, you should also mention your connection to the city, for example if you own or operate a business in town or your children attend school within the city limits. Your time will be limited to 3 minutes. You don't have to take up the whole time if you don't want. You can write down the points that you want to be sure to make, and practice once or twice beforehand, timing yourself to make sure you are under 3 minutes.</p>
    <p>You can also e-mail all the city councillors to express your opinion. There is a sample message below that you can copy and paste; or you can use your own words and opinions. Remember to sign your name! Also note in your letter what your connection to the community is.</p>

        <p>Dear Silverton City Council,</p>
        <p>I write to you in opposition to Ordinance 24-15 that would change language prohibiting camping in Silverton. I believe that the accompanying establishment of a sanctioned campsite would be detrimental to the character and safety of our town, and would undermine the positive work that has been done here over the years to intentionally and effectively mitigate the harms of homelessness on our community.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, the Silverton community has invested in a partnership with the private non-profit Sheltering Silverton, so rather than persistent and unaddressed campsites scattered throughout our town, we have a safe, supervised, and out-of-the-way place for people connected to Silverton to rest when they have nowhere else to go. </p>
        <p>While many cities around us have either ignored or shifted the demands of housing unavailability onto neighboring cities, over the last eight years Sheltering Silverton has stepped up its operations and now regularly shelters dozens of our neighbors every night, as well as assisting them on their journeys to rehabilitation and re-housing.</p>
        <p>We're lucky here that through this partnership, the scale of our homelessness problem is small and manageable. No one wants our streets, sidewalks, or parks to be taken over by the kinds of unaddressed homeless camps easily found in Portland or Salem. But instead of addressing this problem, your proposed ban coupled with a sanctioned campsite would undermine the work that has been done, and make the problem worse. </p>
        <p>Rather than adopting this ordinance, the Council should instead rely on our Police Department to address campsites on a case-by-case basis, as they appear, and in coordination with social service agencies like Sheltering Silverton, the hospital, and the school district. </p>
        <p>I would remind the Council that Silverton as a whole has not “done nothing” to address homelessness in our midst. We have together created a holistic, community-minded, proactive, intentional, compassionate, and effective response by supporting the efforts of Sheltering Silverton.</p>
        <p>Our community has fostered the gold standard for addressing rural homelessness in the Willamette Valley, if not the entire state of Oregon. Council should not squander these efforts by introducing a ban for the sake of banning, and in doing so create the kind of unpleasant public homeless encampment that all of us want most to avoid.</p>
        <p>Sincerely,</p>
